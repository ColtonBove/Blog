##-Personal Blog-

This is the public repository for my personal website you can find [here](https://coltonbove.com/)

This website was made using ReactJS and styled with a mix of pure CSS and Bootstrap and served mainly as a way for me to familiarize myself with the React Framework

The website will be updated periodically, if you have any questions feel free to reach out to me at jcb164@pitt.edu
