I\u2019m currently a senior computer science student at the University of Pittsburgh, and akin to pretty much any other computer science student or professional software engineer, I use a platform called Github. If you\u2019re not familiar with Github, \u201cGithub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.\u201d To simply put it, Github allows programmers to collaboratively work together on projects in a neat and efficient way.","Now, on to the more interesting part. (hopefully before I lose anyone) Github holds over 1.1 billion contributions from developers across the world. That\u2019s a lot of contributions, and a hell of a lot of code. One of Github\u2019s key initiatives is to provide a platform that enables users to provide open source code for millions of others to use and learn from.","With Covid-19 and the global pandemic still in full swing it might feel like the world is ending, but imagine a scenario in which a global catastrophe were to actually occur. This is essentially a situation in which Github imagined, and is one of the reasons they decided to create the \u201cArctic Code Vault.\u201d ","Github\u2019s Arctic Code Vault is a \u201cdata repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive, a long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain.\u201d The archive is actually inside of a decommissioned coal mine close to the North Pole, and is intended to last for hundreds of years to come.","If you think this sounds a bit crazy, you\u2019re not alone. However, Github isn\u2019t the first to store data inside of a repository in the arctic permafrost. As mentioned before, Github paired with the AWA (Arctic World Archive) in order to make the Arctic Code Vault a possibility. The AWA is an organization founded in 2017 that \u201cholds an impressive collection of valuable digital artefacts and irreplaceable information from around the world.\u201d The AWA already stores things like manuscripts from the Vatican Library, various scientific breakthroughs, and masterpieces from artists like Rembrandt and Munch. Their mission is to store data in \u201cthe safest location on Earth,\u201d a place capable of withstanding both natural and man-made disasters.","So that\u2019s pretty cool and all, but how is github intending to store such a large amount of digital information inside of a very physical place? For starters, github took a snapshot of each repository\u2019s most recent version. From there they compressed the data and encoded it into a QR-code. They also included a human-readable index that explains how to recover the data on each data reel. Overall, the data snapshot which was taken on February 2nd of 2020 contains 21TB of data, and fits onto 186 reels of film. ","In my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Arctic Code Vault is how wide-reaching the code vault extends. The repository contains every Github repo with any commits between the original announcement of the vault to February 2nd. Additionally, every repo with at least one star and any commits from prior years were included, along with any existing repo at all that had at least 250 stars. What that means for any of the Github users reading this is that you probably have code currently residing somewhere in the arctic permafrost. In fact you don\u2019t even have to make an assumption of your potential contribution to the code vault. Github has created a badge that appears on your profile as an \u201cArctic Code Vault Contributor,\u201d and well, I think that\u2019s pretty nifty. ","Github\u2019s initiative creates an interesting conversation regarding long-term storage of digital information. I\u2019ve personally never thought about the physical storage of electronic data, and I especially never imagined that the physical manifestation of this data would be stored somewhere deep in an old coal mine in the arctic. I\u2019m curious to see how this will affect other companies and organizations moving forward, and I\u2019m also curious to see what kind of data we deem \u201cworthy\u201d of protecting like this in the future.","If you\u2019d like to learn more details about the Arctic Code Vault or the Arctic World Archive I\u2019d suggest visiting their respective websites linked here: ","https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/","https://arcticworldarchive.org/ "]}')},54:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"title":"Cooking, even if you\u2019re an idiot?","paragraphs":["Time to talk about food, something virtually everyone is a fan of. Even if you\u2019re a picky eater or have dietary restrictions I\u2019m sure there\u2019s at least some type of food you can get excited about. What I find confusing is while seemingly everyone loves to eat, there aren\u2019t nearly as many people who love to cook, or even really claim to \u201cknow\u201d how to cook. I\u2019ll be the first to admit, as a college kid I may have a bit of bias in regards to the general population\u2019s cooking knowledge. I\u2019ve seen plenty of college diets consisting of solely frozen foods and instant ramen. However, I still think there\u2019s something to be said about cooking. ","Growing up my parents, and more specifically my mom, did pretty much all of the cooking in our family. Thanks mom! However, my opinion is that cooking is a basic human skill; we should all know how to do it. While I\u2019m not suggesting that you start baking a souffle at 3 years old (though if you can do that, more power to you), it might at least help you to know how to scramble eggs by the time you\u2019re 20. Hopefully I don\u2019t sound too patronizing so far, you certainly won\u2019t be seeing me on Iron Chef anytime soon. However, I do believe that absolutely anyone is capable of cooking, Bobby Flay or not.","This year I decided to put together Christmas dinner for my family. I planned out everything I wanted to make, went shopping for the ingredients, and with the help of my mom playing sous chef, (thanks again mom!) made a pretty decent Christmas dinner consisting mainly of italian foods. Chicken cacciatore, italian wedding soup, and a vegetable lasagna were the main things we made, and for the first time making all of those dishes, it turned out pretty well! The point of talking about everything I made really isn\u2019t to brag, but instead mention how I went about cooking everything; using online recipes. ","At the end of the day that\u2019s how easy it is, looking up what you\u2019d like to make online, obtaining the ingredients, and reading the instructions until you get your end product. I\u2019m under the impression that if you know how to read then you know how to cook. The process really isn\u2019t all that intimidating, and in due time you might even feel like experimenting with your own recipes after gaining some experience in the kitchen. ","Why learn how to cook though when you can easily pick up the phone and order takeout in half the time? Well, I think most people know the answer to that, so instead of answering the question directly I\u2019m going to opt to share some numbers that you may find to be more interesting.","Let\u2019s talk money. The average \u201ccommercially-prepared\u201d meal will cost you about $13, while the average home-cooked meal will bring you to around $4. That\u2019s $9 dollars you\u2019re saving each time you decide to cook at home, and you can multiply that if you\u2019re cooking for others as well. On a more drastic note, cooking dinner at home every day compared to eating out for dinner could save you over $3,000 a year. That\u2019s a bit extreme, so let\u2019s say you eat out for dinner once every Friday night. If you decide to eat out half as much the next year you could be saving over $200 on dinners alone. ","However, let\u2019s say money isn\u2019t an issue (good for you!). A study by Public Health Nutrition states that \u201cadults who cooked dinner at home only once a week consumed 2,300 calories per day on average, including 84 grams of fat and 135 grams of sugar. In comparison, regular at-home cooks ate 150 fewer calories per day and consumed only 81 grams of fat and 119 grams of sugar.\u201d I\u2019ve always found myself to be a \u201cnumbers guy,\u201d but there\u2019s plenty of ways to put those numbers into words. One way is to say that cooking at home could give you a better chance at avoiding things like weight gain, heart disease, and diabetes. ","In conclusion, you can cook. Even if you\u2019re an idiot! More importantly, you should cook. Whether you\u2019re 17 or 83, there\u2019s plenty to be gained from it, and at the very least maybe you can look cool, or just straight up pretend to be Bobby Flay. And hey, if I convinced you to start cooking and you do end up becoming the next Bobby Flay, maybe think about giving me a shout out on your Iron Chef debut episode."]}')},55:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"title":"Another bs productivity hack?","paragraphs":["Well, 2020 is just about over, and what a year it\u2019s been. However outrageous and unusual the year was, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be consistency in the tradition of the New Year\u2019s resolution. If you\u2019re not from America or another place that takes part in this tradition, or if you\u2019ve just been living under a rock for awhile (admittedly not a terrible time to do so), the New Year\u2019s resolution is essentially a tradition where someone picks some aspect of their life in which they hope to better themselves, and then proceeds to better themselves in said aspect for about 2 weeks before ditching it entirely. If you\u2019d like to get ahead of the curve for 2021 I\u2019d suggest pre-ordering a set of dumbbells or other workout equipment, and then promptly storing it in a closet so that you never touch it again.","Obviously the above paragraph was a joke, but if you\u2019re someone who legitimately makes and then proceeds to effectively follow your New Year\u2019s Resolution, then congratulations to you. In reality, I feel as if it\u2019s a bit healthier to constantly be setting different goals regardless of the time of year, but if the New Year helps you start your goal-setting journey then I say go for it. Regardless, I always find the slew of self-help and productivity articles popping up at this time to be pretty dry and repetitive. ","In the holiday spirit, I\u2019ve decided to write my very own dry and repetitive productivity article, and I hope it gives you a renewed sense of motivation for like 30 minutes, just like all the other ones. In all seriousness, I do believe self-help/productivity articles and books can effectively motivate and inspire, I\u2019m just merely referencing the tacky articles you might be seeing a lot of at this time of year. ","While I\u2019m nowhere remotely close to being an expert on the matter, I\u2019d like to share one small thing I\u2019ve noticed over the course of my life that has greatly influenced my productivity and personal accomplishments. The cool thing about my tip, is that it\u2019s something you can let other people do for you. Simply put, my one tip is to encourage you to surround yourself with friends and coworkers that inspire you. ","I\u2019ll admit it, it\u2019s definitely a tough time if you\u2019re looking to \u201csurround\u201d yourself with people, but luckily you have plenty of ways for digital communication these days. From my personal experience, I\u2019ve always found that I\u2019m at my personal best when I\u2019m surrounded by people that are also doing their best. ","The first time I ever noticed how much of an impact other people had on my productivity was in High School. I\u2019ve been extremely lucky to have been surrounded with such incredible friends; people that I enjoy the presence of, and people that do some absolutely amazing things, in turn, inspiring me to achieve somewhat equally as amazing things. At just a single point in time, I\u2019ve had friends that blew me away with their academic prowess, musical skill, and straight up physical achievement. Along the way they\u2019ve motivated me to practice harder, study more, think creatively, and even exercise more. I can\u2019t claim that any of my accomplishments were based solely off of my own skill or expertise, and I can\u2019t stress enough how important it\u2019s been to find people that strive to inspire. ","This foundation of friends and colleagues has been so monumentally important to me even as I progressed past High School, as it enabled me to find equally as awesome and inspiring people in college and in a professional environment. One of the coolest parts about this process is that the entire thing is like a feedback loop. You become inspired and motivated through your peers, and in turn other people can become inspired and motivated by you.","It could very well be that I\u2019m speaking the obvious through writing this post, but a reminder can\u2019t ever hurt. At the very least I got to give a bit of a shout out to my awesome friends, but hopefully you can find something of value from this post. As we head into 2021 I wish everyone the best in their future endeavors and goals, whether it\u2019s one you\u2019ve set this New Year, or not."]}')},56:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"title":"The Ideal Body?","paragraphs":["I\u2019m a 21 year old male. I\u2019m 6 feet tall, and I weigh 160 pounds. Some might consider my age to be at or near my physical prime. At this point, I could be the \u201cmost attractive\u201d I\u2019ll ever be, but what does that really mean? ","To answer the question, not much. Something that I always thought to be one of the coolest possibilities about the human body is that we have the power to change it. Want to drop a few pounds? You can do that. Want to pack on some muscle? You can also do that. Change the color of your hair? Sure thing. On a more extreme note we could even surgically modify different aspects of the way we look. What\u2019s even more amazing is that we don\u2019t need to do any of those things at all. There\u2019s also the possibility to be content with the way we look. The unfortunate thing is that most people aren\u2019t so happy with the way they look, but why is that?","Well the issue in its entirety is pretty complex, and I\u2019m nowhere near an expert on the matter. Simply put, the media puts a lot of pressure on society to look and act a certain way. ","For me, that pressure feels a lot like needing to put on a few extra pounds. Ever since I can remember I\u2019ve always been a pretty skinny kid. I can look back at pictures from elementary school to present day, and in all of them, I\u2019m pretty skinny. One of the interesting things is that it never really mattered to me until around High School. Why the change in mindset happened, I can\u2019t say for sure, and it\u2019s likely that a lot of different reasons contributed to it. In hindsight, it turns out that I\u2019m pretty lucky. According to the Melrose Center, (facilities that specialize in treating eating disorders) by the age of 10, 80% of kids are already concerned with being \u201ctoo fat.\u201d Additionally, problems are worse with women, and at age 17, they find that 78% of girls are unhappy with their bodies. ","There are plenty of other scary statistics worth noting, but I feel as if those alone get across the point. I wish I could provide a solution to some of these problems, but as I\u2019ve mentioned before, I\u2019m no expert on the subject. Instead, what I\u2019d like to talk about is an interesting article that I came across recently. ","The article entitled, \u201cWomen overestimate men\u2019s attraction to thin female fashion models\u201d unsurprisingly, talks about how women overestimate men\u2019s attraction to the media\u2019s idea of the \u201cideal female body.\u201d Essentially, the article takes you through a few studies where people \u201crate\u201d female model\u2019s bodies, and then proceed to estimate how the other gender rated the models. As suggested in the title, the study found that females thought that males would rate the model\u2019s bodies more favorably than they actually did. In conclusion, the authors figured that the study could be used to \u201clessen the negative impact of unhealthy beauty standards.\u201d ","I think that the article can raise a pretty interesting discussion regarding society\u2019s \u201cideal body image\u201d for both men and women. It almost begs the question, \u201cwho are fashion models presenting to?\u201d A question with a simple answer, but until reading the article, I\u2019ve never personally thought much about it at all. ","Female models present themselves to a female base of customers and likewise for males and male models. Victoria\u2019s secret might as well be the fact that their models are geared towards women rather than men. Men aren\u2019t typically in the market for bras and lingerie, and because of that their models have no need to appeal directly to them. The fashion models for women\u2019s fashion companies like Victoria\u2019s Secret advertise specifically to their female customers. The same can be said about male models in the fashion industry. The reality for men is that male bodybuilders and other models appeal more to men than they do to females.","That\u2019s not to say that men aren\u2019t attracted to the skinny fashion models in magazines, or that women don\u2019t like the ripped guys you can find selling you protein powder on facebook. What it\u2019s really saying is that the importance we put on ourselves to look this way may be much more a product of the media and advertisement than the standards of those we aim to attract.","Do I think that this mindset can put an end to body image issues as a whole? Absolutely not, but I think that it\u2019s worth noting, and definitely something interesting to think about. In a way it\u2019s comforting to think that we\u2019re the ones putting extra pressure on ourselves to look a certain way, rather than thinking we need to look a certain way to be deemed attractive by someone else. I\u2019d like to believe that getting a better understanding of the why and how behind the body standards portrayed in the media can be a small nudge in the right direction of being comfortable in our own skin.
